# World-s-Oldest-Businesses
What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses
Project Description:
An important part of business was planning for the future and ensuring that the business survived changing market conditions. Some businesses did this remarkably well and lasted for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries did they belong to?
Like many business problems, the data I explored was contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
TECHNOLOGIES:
  SQL
  Python
Project Tasks:
  1. The oldest business in the world
  2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?
  3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?
  4. Exploring the categories
